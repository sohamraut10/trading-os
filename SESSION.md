# Trading OS — Build Session Log

End-to-end record of what was designed, built, fixed, and shipped in this session.

---

## What Was Built

A complete **AI-powered Trading Operating System** with a multi-agent consensus architecture. The system runs 4 specialist AI agents in parallel, passes their decisions through a Devil's Advocate auditor, and feeds everything into a Meta-Agent Consensus Engine that produces a final TRUE/FALSE trade signal with Kelly-sized position sizing.

---

## Architecture

```
Market Data → [Technical | Sentiment | Quant | OrderFlow] ──┐
                                                              ├→ Meta-Agent Consensus → Risk Engine → Broker
                                                Devil's Advocate (auditor, veto power) ──────────────┘
```

### Agents

| Agent | Method | Signal Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical Analyst** | Pure NumPy | RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, ATR — scoring rubric → 50–95% confidence |
| **Sentiment & News** | Claude Haiku (Anthropic SDK) | Structured JSON prompt; keyword heuristic fallback with 20% confidence penalty |
| **Quant & Statistical** | R/S analysis | Hurst exponent (trend vs. mean-reversion regime), Z-score, rolling Sharpe, Kelly EV |
| **Market Structure** | Pivot-based | S/R levels, volume profile POC, bid/ask imbalance, liquidity voids, large-order detection |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Rule-based | 9 risk flags: earnings risk, macro shock, overextension, correlated crash, loss streak, near-event, spread, gap, regime mismatch — returns SELL veto or HOLD |

### Meta-Agent Consensus Rules
- DA veto: ≥85% SELL confidence → block entire signal
- Filter: agents below 55% confidence excluded from vote
- TRUE signal requires: ≥3/4 agents agree **AND** average confidence ≥68%
- Regime multiplier applied to weights (bull/bear/volatile/ranging)
- Position size: half-Kelly criterion

## Bugs Fixed During Session

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| OOM / exit 137 on test suite | `scope="module"` fixtures kept 500-candle agent pipelines alive across all modules simultaneously | Reduced candles to 400, removed custom `event_loop` fixture, added `pytest.ini` with `asyncio_mode = auto` |
| History empty in orchestrator tests | `_history.append()` only ran inside `run_forever()` loop; tests calling `run_cycle()` directly saw empty history | Extracted `_append_history()` helper called from both success and error paths |
| R:R warning test false positive | Risk engine always overrode `tp_pct` with `sl × 2.0` regardless of signal's suggested TP, so ratio was always 2.0 | Changed to `tp_pct = raw_tp if raw_tp >= min_tp else min_tp`; test updated to verify floor behaviour |
| Kelly test values equal | Both win rates (0.55 and 0.70) hit `max_pct=0.05` cap | Test passes `max_pct=1.0` to allow uncapped comparison |
| Pydantic v2 deprecation (11 warnings) | `Field(env=...)` and `class Config:` patterns from Pydantic v1 | Migrated to `SettingsConfigDict`, removed `Field(env=...)`, sub-configs changed to `BaseModel` |
| `aiohttp` missing | Not in venv | `uv pip install aiohttp` |
| Edit string mismatch in orchestrator.py | Unicode box-drawing chars caused match failure | Re-read exact bytes, matched correctly |

## Key Design Decisions

**Pure NumPy indicators** — no TA-Lib dependency; all indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger, VWAP, ATR) implemented from scratch for portability.

**Hurst exponent via R/S analysis** — classifies regime as trending (H > 0.55) or mean-reverting (H < 0.45) to weight agent signals accordingly.

**Half-Kelly position sizing** — full Kelly is theoretically optimal but practically dangerous; half-Kelly halves the bet size, reducing drawdown significantly.

**70/30 walk-forward split in optimizer** — in-sample grid search on 70% of candles, out-of-sample validation on remaining 30%. Ranked by `combined_sharpe = (in + out) / 2` to penalise overfit.

**InMemoryBus fallback** — Kafka is optional; `make_bus()` returns `InMemoryBus` when no Kafka brokers are configured, so the system runs locally without Docker.

**Custom Prometheus metrics** — no `prometheus_client` library; `Gauge`, `Counter`, `Histogram` classes render to OpenMetrics text format directly, keeping the dependency footprint minimal.

## How to Run

### Local (no Docker)
```bash
cd trading-os
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Full stack (Docker Compose)
```bash
cd infrastructure
docker compose up -d
```
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### Key endpoints
```
GET  /health                  — liveness + portfolio equity
POST /analyze                 — run full multi-agent consensus on an asset
POST /backtest                — walk-forward backtest
POST /backtest/optimize       — grid-search parameter optimization
GET  /portfolio               — current equity, positions, P&L
GET  /agents/performance      — per-agent accuracy and weights
GET  /metrics                 — Prometheus metrics scrape
WS   /ws/signals              — real-time signal stream
```

### Run tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Deploy to Vercel

Serverless functions can't hold a WebSocket open or run an indefinite
background loop, and give no guarantee of in-memory state surviving between
invocations — so the deployment differs from Docker/local in three ways:

- `/ws/signals` and `/ws/events` still exist (for Docker/local clients) but
  the dashboard instead polls `GET /events/recent` (same Postgres `events`
  table, just pulled instead of pushed).
- `live_suggestions_loop`'s always-on background task is replaced by
  `GET /cron/tick`, wired up as a Vercel Cron in `vercel.json`
  (`*/10 * * * *` by default — adjust for your plan's cron limits).
- Portfolio equity/cash resume from the latest `portfolio_snapshots` row on
  every cold start instead of resetting to the hardcoded starting equity.
  Per-symbol open positions are **not** persisted (no positions table yet),
  so they — and any unrealized P&L they represented — are still lost across
  a cold start. `AdaptiveWeightManager`'s learned weights also still persist
  to a local JSON file (`/tmp/agent_performance.json`), which is
  serverless-ephemeral, so weight recalibration can reset between cold
  starts; only equity/cash/events/signals are Postgres-backed.

Required setup:
1. **An external Postgres** — Vercel doesn't host one. Point `DATABASE_URL`
   at a managed instance (Neon, Supabase, Railway, etc.) and load
   `infrastructure/init.sql` against it once.
2. **Vercel project env vars**: `DATABASE_URL`, `MOCK_MODE=true` (for a demo
   deployment with no exchange/broker keys), `CRON_SECRET` (Vercel
   auto-sends `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` on cron requests — this
   is what `GET /cron/tick` checks), `API_AUTH_TOKEN` (protects trade/portfolio
   mutation endpoints), and whichever of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
   `ALPACA_API_KEY` / `BINANCE_API_KEY` / `NEWS_API_KEY` you actually have.
3. **Dashboard build env var**: set `VITE_API_BASE=/api` on the Vercel
   project so the dashboard calls `/api/*` (where `api/index.py` mounts the
   backend) instead of same-origin root paths.
4. `vercel deploy` (or connect the GitHub repo in the Vercel dashboard).

`vercel.json` builds the dashboard as a static site and `api/index.py` as
the API's Python serverless function. `api/index.py` builds its own
top-level FastAPI app and includes `api.main`'s router under `/api` — it
does **not** use `app.mount()`, because Starlette's `Mount` doesn't forward
ASGI lifespan events to a mounted sub-app, which would silently skip
`state.db.connect()` (and the portfolio resume) entirely.
